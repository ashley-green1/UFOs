# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a clean webpage that contains a dynamic table of UFO sighting data.  We've designed this table using Javascript as the primary coding language.  Via the webpage, the end user can filter the data by various criteria and instantly see the results. 


## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: E6+, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, D3


## Results


Resulting is a webpage with a little background on the controversy behind UFO sightings and their significance.  
Just below, you will find sighting data that includes the following:
-  date
-  location
-  UFO descriptive data
-  witness comments

The user will be able to enter date, location and descriptive data to filter the data table see the results that match their criteria.





## Summary
### Drawback
While the table is great, one drawback is that Javascript language is case sensitive.  This is can impact the user experience because all of the searchable data is lowercase.  For example, if a user were to enter "CA" to identify the UFO sightings in California, the filter search results are zero.  Whereas, if they were to enter "ca" in lower case, there are plenty of results. 

### Recommendations
At a quick glance, there are over seven "shape" results for the shape filter.  The filter currently allows the end user to filter shape data by simply typing the search criteria into the search field.  A dropdown option would enhance the user experience if there were a dropdown option for "Shape" due to the broad range of descriptions.  Those unfamiliar with UFO sightings may not know that "light" is considered a shape for UFOs. 

It would also enhance the user experience to include a search result counter that displays the number of results for the searched criteria.
