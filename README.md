# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a clean webpage that contains a dynamic table of UFO sighting data.  We've designed this table using Javascript as the primary coding language.  Via the webpage, the end user can filter the data by various criteria and instantly see the results. 


## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: E6+, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, D3


## Results
Resulting is a webpage with a little background on the controversy behind UFO sightings and their significance.  Just below, you will find sighting data that includes the following:
-  date
-  location
-  UFO descriptive data
-  witness comments

The user will be able to enter date, location and descriptive data to filter the data table see the results that match their criteria.

## Summary

When surfing, the 80s can be uncomfortable and the 60s typically require a wetsuit, but the 70s are just about right.  

With December being one of the coldest months of the year, we can see from the lower quartile and that temperatures range from 56-69 for about one week.  Thats not too bad.  The colder weather may drive sales for wetsuits and other related gear, which is good for business.  However, ice cream sales may not be as rewarding. 

June presents almost the opposite with the hottest week of the month randing from 77 to 85 degrees.  This is good for ice cream sales to cool those who may get uncomfortable in the higher temperatures.  

To dive deeper, we decided to analyze the precipitation statistics taking the same steps we used to get the temperature stats.  Per wikipedia "Heavy rain is when the precipitation rate is > 7.6 mm (0.30 in) per hour."  Rain can reduce foot traffic and compromise ice cream sales, or worse, skiers may sit the day out.

Precipitation in June averages 0.14 mm and can range from 0-4.43 mm. We can conclude that there is at least one slightly rainy day per month that may deter skiers. However, majority of the month, precipitation is less than 0.12 mm.

Precipitation in December averages 0.21 mm, but can range from 0-6.42 mm.  We can conclude that there is at least one nearly heavy rain day per month that may deter skiers. However, majority of the month, precipitation is less than 0.15 mm.

After analyzing both the temperature and precipitation for the 2 risky months of June and December, we've reveal that there are no threats to the stability of the business operating year round.  Expanding to the Oahu, Hawaii location would be a great addition to the Surfs Up retail ventures.
